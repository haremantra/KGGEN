\begin{abstract}
This Product Requirements Document specifies a knowledge graph-based legal contract analysis system that applies the KGGEN methodology to the CUAD dataset for technology agreements. The system extracts structured knowledge from legal contracts using a three-stage pipeline (entity extraction, aggregation, entity resolution), maps clauses to 41 CUAD label categories, and provides LLM-powered semantic retrieval for contract analysis. Targeting legal professionals and engineering teams, the system aims to reduce contract review time and costs while maintaining high accuracy through expert-validated extraction and human-in-the-loop workflows. Key innovations include hybrid BM25 and semantic retrieval, multi-hop graph traversal for context assembly, and a technology-focused ontology covering software licensing, IP ownership, and restrictive covenants common in technology agreements.

\section{Executive Summary}

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Legal contract review costs law firms hundreds of thousands of dollars per transaction, with billing rates of \$500-\$900 per hour and approximately 50\% of lawyer time spent on contract analysis~\cite{ceb2017contract}. The repetitive task of finding relevant clauses in lengthy contracts---determining termination dates, identifying anti-assignment provisions, locating liability caps---consumes enormous resources yet requires limited expert judgment. Small businesses and individuals often cannot afford professional review, leading to predatory contract terms and consumer harm~\cite{hendrycks2021cuad}.

\subsection{Proposed Solution}

We propose a knowledge graph-based contract analysis system that applies KGGen~\cite{mo2025kggen}, a state-of-the-art text-to-knowledge-graph extractor, to the CUAD dataset~\cite{hendrycks2021cuad}, the largest expert-annotated legal contract review benchmark. Our system:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Extracts} structured knowledge from contracts using LLM-based entity and relation identification
    \item \textbf{Organizes} contract information into a knowledge graph following CUAD's 41-category ontology
    \item \textbf{Retrieves} relevant context using hybrid BM25 and semantic search with multi-hop graph traversal
    \item \textbf{Synthesizes} natural language analysis using LLMs grounded in extracted knowledge graph facts
\end{enumerate}

The initial phase focuses on \textbf{technology agreements}, addressing clauses particularly relevant to software licensing, IP ownership, non-compete restrictions, and liability provisions.

\subsection{Key Benefits}

\textbf{For Legal Professionals:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduce contract review time by 50-70\% through automated clause extraction
    \item Increase review accuracy with structured knowledge graph representations
    \item Enable semantic search across contract portfolios (``Show all perpetual licenses'')
    \item Identify risks and obligations without reading entire contracts
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Organizations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lower transaction costs from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands of dollars
    \item Democratize access to legal support for small businesses and individuals
    \item Standardize contract analysis across teams
    \item Build institutional knowledge in reusable knowledge graph format
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Engineering Teams:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Leverage state-of-the-art KGGEN pipeline achieving 66\% accuracy~\cite{mo2025kggen}
    \item Build on CUAD's \$2 million expert-annotated dataset~\cite{hendrycks2021cuad}
    \item Deploy proven NLP techniques (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa) for specialized domains
\end{itemize}
